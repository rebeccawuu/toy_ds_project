    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart Disease is a major issue which contributes to global morbidity and mortality (Dai et al., 2021). In the United States of America, one person dies every 34 seconds from a heart disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Many people who have a heart disease do not show any physical symptoms and as a result are not diagnosed (Jin 2014). In turn, these individuals are not taking medications to help prevent the progression of the heart disease. Thus, predictive models are needed to help diagnose patients especially those who are asymptomatic in order to intervene with the progression of the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be examining the Heart Disease Data from the University of California, Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is collected from three separate countries, the United States, Switerland, and Hungary. It is composed of 14 different variables which are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak — ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels and Thalassemia. All 14 variables are quantatitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major role of this project is to use the variables from the dataset to help predict whether a patient has a heart disease or not. In the methods we will discuss further which variables we will be examining."

    "We obtained the heart disease data from the UCI ICS website as seen in the below code. Originally, the data was collected from four separate regions, Hungary, Switzerland, Cleveland, and Long Beach. As the original data sets did not have the column names, we added that into our data set based on the documentation. In our data set, we combined all four regions to create the \"heart_data\" dataset for our project. To do so we used rbind as all datasets which had the same number of variables."
